<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Johnny Stark</span>, director
of the department of Interplanetary
Relations for
Mars' Settlement One, reread the
final paragraph of the note which
he had found on his desk, upon
returning from lunch earlier in
the day.</p>

<p>His eye flicked rapidly over
the moistly smeared Martian
scrawl, ignoring the bitterness
directed at him in the first paragraphs.
He was vaguely troubled
by the last sentences. But he
hadn't been able to pin the feeling
down.</p>

<div class="bq"><p><i>... Our civilization predates
that of Earth's by millions of
years. We are an advanced, peaceful
race. Yet, since Earth's first
rocket landed here thirteen years
ago, we have been looked upon as
freaks and contemptuously called
'bug-men' behind our backs! This
is our planet. We gave of our far-advanced
knowledge and science
freely, so that Earth would be a
better place. We asked nothing
in return, but we were rewarded
by having forced upon us foreign
ideas of government, religion,
and behavior. Our protests have
been silenced by an armed-police
and punitive system we've never
before needed. Someday you will
awaken to this injustice. On that
day in your life, you have my
sympathy and pity!</i></p></div>

<p>Stark knew that the Settlement's
Investigations Lab could
readily determine the identity of
the Martian who had written the
note. But he hesitated to send it
over. Under the New System,
such troublemakers were banished
to the slave-labor details
of the precious-earth mines to
the North.</p>

<p>Crumpling the note in sudden
decision, Stark dropped it into
the office incendiary tube. The
morning visi-report had shown
that there were more than 17,000
workers at the mines. Only five
had been Earthlings. Let the
armed-police system find the
Martian through their own channels.
It wasn't his job.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">A&nbsp;glance</span> at the solar clock
on the far wall reminded him
there was still time for one more
interview before the last bell, so
he impatiently signaled his secretary
to send in the waiting
couple.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, he liked his work
and time meant little to him. He
had jumped from interpreter to
director in the ten years since
the department had been created.
But this day was different.</p>

<p>Stark was to announce his engagement
at the Chief's monthly
dinner party that evening and
time had seemed to drag since
his lunch with Carol.</p>

<p>When the door opened, he rose
and nodded to the plump, freckle-faced
girl who entered. The
girl topped five feet by one or
two inches, but she was no taller
than the Martian man who followed
her at the prescribed four
feet.</p>

<p>After the girl had seated herself,
Stark and the Martian sat
down. Stark opened the folder,
which his secretary had placed on
his desk earlier.</p>

<p>"Your names are Ruth and
Ralph Gilraut? And you want
permission to move into Housing
Perimeter D?" It was merely a
formality, since the information
was in the folder.</p>

<p>When the girl nodded, Stark
placed a small check mark in the
space beside her name. Then he
turned to the Martian.</p>

<p>The large, single red eye set
deep in the Martian's smooth,
green forehead above the two
brown ones blinked twice before
he answered.</p>

<p>He spoke deliberately. "As is
required of all Martians under
the New System, I have taken
the name of one of the early
Earthlings to write and pronounce."
The large red eye blinked
again. "My wife would like to
move into Housing Perimeter D.
By regulation, I respect her
wish."</p>

<div class="figr"><img src="images/001.png" width="356" height="500" alt="" title="" /></div>

<p>Stark placed a check mark by
the Martian's name. He wiped
the smudge of ink off his hand
and said, "You both know, of
course, that Perimeter D is reserved
for couples who have intermarried
and are about to have
offspring?"</p>

<p>The girl and the Martian nodded,
and the girl passed Stark a
medical report. Stark looked over
the report and then made a notation
on a small pink slip.</p>

<p>He said, "This permit certifies
that you are eligible to move
from Perimeter E to Housing Perimeter
D. It also certifies that
your husband has no record as a
troublemaker." Stark looked at
the girl. "You understand that
you may visit your friends in Perimeter
E, but, by law, they will
not be allowed to enter Perimeter
D to visit you. And, of course,
the new law clearly states that
neither of you may visit Earthlings
in Housing Perimeter A,
B or C."</p>

<p>The girl looked down at her
hands. Her voice was almost inaudible.
"My husband and I are
familiar with the advantages and
disadvantages listed under the
section pertaining to intermarriage
in the new law, Mr. Stark.
Thank you."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Stark</span> rose as they left. For
a brief moment, he thought
he had detected a sense of rebellion
in their attitude. But that
was not possible.</p>

<p>The new law provided equality
for all. And his department had
been created to iron out relations
between the two races&mdash;excepting
complaints originated by troublemakers
for the purpose of weakening
the New System. In such
cases, Investigations had stepped
in and the Martian or Earthling
troublemaker had been sent to
the rare-earth mines.</p>

<p>The reddish light filtering in
through the quartz and lead wall
of his office showed that it was
almost time for the last bell.</p>

<p>On the street below, shoppers
were streaming out of the stores
on their way to the various housing
perimeters.</p>

<p>Earthlings were climbing into
their speedy little jet cars for the
short trip to the recently modernized
inner perimeters. Martians
were waiting for the slower
auto buses. The traffic problem
had been solved, under the New
System, by restricting the use
of the Martian-built jet cars to
persons living in the inner perimeters.</p>

<p>As Stark watched, a black jet
car impatiently hurtled out of
the line of traffic, bowled through
a crowd of Martians waiting for
an auto bus, and skidded to a
stop at the curb in front of the
building.</p>

<p>A tall girl got out. The red
evening glow reflecting from her
golden hair, made her breathing
globe almost amber. Male Martians
and Earthlings alike turned
to stare in appreciation as she
pushed her way through the
crowd to the building's compressor
lock. Carol was that kind of
girl.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Almost</span> at the exact moment
that Carol opened the door
into Stark's office, the yellow visi-screen
of the vocal box upon
Stark's desk flashed on brilliantly
and the Chief's booming voice
filled the office. The light from the
screen picked up the highlights
on the furniture and gave a sallow,
greenish cast to Stark's features.
Carol stepped back into
the doorway to stay out of range
of the two-way unit.</p>

<p>"Stark!" The automatic tuner
on the box corrected to bring the
Chief's image in wire-sharp focus.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir?"</p>

<p>"About the dinner tonight. Just
checking to make sure you're
planning to be there. We want a
full turnout. An inspection team
has come up from Earth and we
have two visiting dignitaries from
Venus."</p>

<p>Stark nodded and waited for
the Chief to say something else,
but the visi-screen blanked out.</p>

<p>Carol said, "That was Dad,
wasn't it?"</p>

<p>Stark felt very depressed suddenly.
"Haven't you told him
yet?"</p>

<p>"No. He's been tied up with
those inspectors all afternoon.
And you know how Dad is,
Johnny. There's a right and a
wrong time to tell him things.
Right now, he's only interested
in hearing about Earth."</p>

<p>"But we're supposed to announce
our engagement tonight
at the dinner." He shook his head.
"We can't go on forever with just
a few stolen moments here and
there, eating an occasional lunch
or third meal together in little
out-of-the-way places."</p>

<p>Carol laughed, the youthful
swell of her breasts against the
soft, spun-glass material of her
blouse. "Don't worry so, Johnny!
I'm a big girl now. This is my
eighteenth birthday. Dad's bark
is much worse than his bite. I'll
tell him about us on the way
home."</p>

<p>She moved closer to him, until
he could feel the warmth of her
body. He could see the warm,
damp indentation where her
breathing globe had rested
against her shoulders and chest.</p>

<p>She asked teasingly, "What did
you get me for my birthday,
Johnny? Something real nice?"</p>

<p>"What did you want?" Johnny
asked her gently.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">And</span> suddenly she wasn't teasing
any more. She put her
arms around him. "Dad and my
brother would say I'm crazy. But
all I want, Johnny, is you. Just
you! You know that."</p>

<p>Stark had picked out her birthday
present, but he wanted it to
be a surprise for that night. He
said, "I already saw one of your
presents. A black jet car!"</p>

<p>"How did you know that?"</p>

<p>"I saw you drive up in it a
few minutes ago."</p>

<p>Carol giggled. "Dad gave it to
me. Did you see me plow through
that crowd waiting for the auto
bus?"</p>

<p>"Did your brother send you
anything?"</p>

<p>She nodded. "Three new outfits
from Earth. They were on the
same liner that brought the inspection
team to the Settlement
this morning. Oh, yes, and the
captain of the liner brought me
this."</p>

<p>She showed him the tiny pin
she wore attached to her collar.
The pin itself was a carefully
wrought but cruel caricature of
an awkward buglike creature. A
small ruby set in the center of its
face served as its eye.</p>

<p>Stark frowned. "Carol, you
shouldn't be wearing that." He
reached up and unpinned it.
"That's the sort of thing our department
is fighting."</p>

<p>"But the captain said it was
the latest rage back on Earth.
They're even making toys like it.
I'm sure they're not designed to
... to poke fun at anyone."</p>

<p>Stark started to say something,
but the last bell interrupted him.
He said, "If you're going to take
your father home and tell him
about us before the dinner, you'd
better hurry. I'll come early."</p>

<p>Carol kissed him and said
good-by. She left the pin on
Stark's desk and was smiling at
him as she closed the door.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">After</span> waiting until the first
rush of workers had gone and
the building was quiet, Stark
caught the elevator down. The
overhead lights in the compressor
lock were reflected in the twin
rows of breathing globes. The
green-tinted ones had to be used
by Martians in the building, and
the clear ones were used by
Earthmen when they were outside
in the Martian atmosphere.
Stark stopped in at a little open
shop down one of the many side
streets. The sign said "Closed,"
but he rang the bell until a little,
dried-up Martian appeared.</p>

<p>The storekeeper handed him a
small box. Stark opened it to examine
the ring&mdash;Carol's birthday
present. The single, large diamond
set in the thin precious-metal
band dated back to an
all-but-forgotten custom practiced
on Earth. Stark thought the
engagement ring would please
Carol, though.</p>

<p>Standing in the compressor
lock at the Chief's home later,
Stark rubbed the diamond against
the sleeve of his tunic. He fumbled
with his breathing globe and
then pushed the button that activated
the door. The tele-guard
beyond the opening door scanned
him rapidly. As he stepped forward,
a red light above the tele-guard
flashed on and the door
began to close again.</p>

<p>Stark threw all his strength
against the door and squeezed
through into the house.</p>

<p>Throughout the house, Stark
could hear the alarm bell. A taped
voice, activated by the tele-guard,
said, "Do not enter! Do not enter!"</p>

<p>He found Carol and the Chief
in the library alone. Nearly purple
with rage, the Chief drew himself
up to his full six feet.</p>

<p>The Chief bellowed, "Stark!
Are you crazy?"</p>

<p>The growing feeling of sickness
spread through Stark.</p>

<p>"Who do you think you are?"
the Chief yelled. "Get back to
your office and consider yourself
under arrest as a troublemaker.
Give you people an inch and you
try to walk away with everything.
Why, I wouldn't let you touch
my daughter if you were the last
living being in the Universe!"</p>

<p>Carol didn't look up. She stood
through it all, silently, without
moving. Stark knew now where
his blind spot had been. He turned
and left them.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Back</span> at his office, he waited
for the police. Stark stared
down at his reflection in the polished
top of the desk. A yellow,
moist film of sweat covered his
face. The red eye set in his forehead
blinked. But the pain visible
just behind the surface of that
eye was not over Carol or himself.</p>

<p>The pain was for what he was
seeing for the first time ... now.</p>
